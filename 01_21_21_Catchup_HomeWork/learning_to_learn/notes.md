# Learning to Learn

## Week 1
### Introduction to Focused and Diffuse modes
  - Focued mode is the familiar state of being zoned in on a particular problem and working with a set of closely related concepts and ideas.
  - Diffuse mode is purposly unfocusing so disparate ideas and thoughts in your head have ability to connect and interplay with each other.

- Take Away: When you are learning something new your mind needs to be in the focused and diffuse mode. Do a little bit everyday.



### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep
  - Procrastination happens when you think you are going to feel pain during an activity so you switch to another more pleasurable task. The reality is that that pridiction of pain is incorrect and the actual feeling of pain shortly after the activity is started is nonexistant.

  - Use the Pomodoro Technique to set and intention and focus for a time period.

  - Practice makes Permanent, The more abstract a concept is the more important it is to practice that concept in order to build the neural pathway.

  - Use spaced repitition to keep the neural pathways you have built strong so the information doesn't fade away.
